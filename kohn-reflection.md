  There have been many times where I have taken the easy way out for an assignment in the past. Often times teachers will set a page limit range, for example “This paper should be 6-10 pages”, and as soon as I reach that minimum range of in this example 6 pages, I will figure out a way to wrap up my paper and have my conclusion on that page 6. I have done the exact same thing with word limits too where as soon as I hit the minimum word limit, I will feel accomplished and wrap up my paper. I have done this even if I have not extensively done all my research, often I am sure there could be more research out there to cover parts of the topic my paper had not covered yet. Even writing this paper I am sure I will not write much more than the 500-word, one page limit.
	
  I found it very relatable where the article talked about how grades tend to reduce the quality of students’ thinking. I have had plenty of teachers in the past give out study guides with terms to know for an upcoming exam. Instead of reading the book and getting the most out of it as I could I simply look up the terms in the appendix, find where they are, and study only what those terms mean. Yes, it has worked out for me in the sense that I will get good grades on the exams and in the class. The paragraph about this in the article states that graded groups had worse recall of facts a week later. I find this to be very true as often I will look back at classes and exams, I took that I got very good grades on and try to remember what I actually learned from those classes. Often, I wind up telling myself that there is no way if I took those same exams today, that I would even pass them.
